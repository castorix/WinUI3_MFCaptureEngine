# WinUI3_MFCaptureEngine

Test [IMFCaptureEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/mfcaptureengine/nn-mfcaptureengine-imfcaptureengine) in WinUI 3, Windows App SDK 1.1.0, Windows 10 22H2
adapted from MS SDK sample : [CaptureEngineVideoCapture](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/main/Samples/CaptureEngineVideoCapture)

I sometimes got a crash at startup : "Indirect call guard check detected invalid control transfer",
so maybe there is a bug somewhere...
